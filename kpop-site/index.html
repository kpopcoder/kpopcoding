        <p>I decided to make my first website in dedication to my love for kpop music. I have been listening to it for almost 16 years now.</p>
            <p>I find a new song that I like every year, so my loved songs range anywhere from 90s kpop to current songs. A couple of my 
            favourite bands include:<br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>GFRIEND</li>
                <li>MAMAMOO</li>
                <li>2NE1</li>
                <li>Hyuna</li>
                <li>Red Velvet</li> 
                <li>Big Bang</li>
                <li>...And many more!</li>
            </ul> <br></p>
            <p>One of my favourite ever singers is Eunha from <strong>Gfriend</strong>, as her voice is light, cute and strong. 
            I also love the husky quality of Hwasa's voice from <strong>MAMAMOO</strong>. It's seductive and raspy. Perfect for her visual.</p>
